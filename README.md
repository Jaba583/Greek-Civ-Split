All credits to DW8030 and their 3rd & 4th Unique Component Mod for the Acropolis image.
Acropolis and Hoplite are placeholders, at least in their current form.

Planned: Macedonian Peltast > Hoplite replacement > Sparta > Thebes > Corinth (Probably) > Argos (Maybe?) > Minoa/Epirus/Syracuse/etc (Maybe?)
